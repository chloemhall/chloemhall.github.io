I am now working to understand the role of mechanosensation following traumatic brain injury.\n\n\nBackground\nI started my research career working on synaptic transmission in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, also investigating the glial response (2015-2017, UCL). For my PhD, I moved into the field of mechanobiology, looking at physical brain changes in healthy ageing and Alzheimer’s disease, using atomic force microscopy (2017-2021, UCL & University of Brighton)."
