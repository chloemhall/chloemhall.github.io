### About 

I am an interdisciplinary scientist, interested in the mechanobiology of the brain, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury.

I am currently a postdoc at the medical university at JGU-Mainz, working with Thomas Mittmann. I am now working to understand the role of mechanosensation following traumatic brain injury.

### Background

I started my research career working on synaptic transmission in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, also investigating the glial response (*2015-2017, UCL*). For my PhD, I moved into the field of mechanobiology, looking at physical brain changes in healthy ageing and Alzheimer's disease, using atomic force microscopy (*2017-2021, UCL & University of Brighton*).
